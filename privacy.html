      <h2>Our Approach to Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Spinnah apps are built with privacy as a core principle. Your data is yours.  
        We do not collect personal information, analytics data, or tracking identifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any content you create in our apps stays on your devices and, when applicable,
        in your private iCloud storage under your Apple ID.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Spinnah apps are designed to avoid collecting user data wherever possible.
        We do not run our own analytics, marketing, or advertising SDKs inside the apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words: we don’t track how you use the app, we don’t build profiles about you,
        and we don’t sell or share data with third parties.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>iCloud and Apple Services</h2>
      <p>
        For apps that support syncing or backup through iCloud, we use only Apple-provided APIs
        to store and sync your content securely. Your data is associated with your Apple ID and
        handled under Apple’s own privacy and security policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spinnah does not operate external servers for app data, and we do not have direct access
        to the information stored in your iCloud account.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>On-Device Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Most app data is stored locally on your device using Apple frameworks (such as SwiftData,
        Core Data, or local file storage). Removing the app from your device may remove this data,
        depending on your system settings and whether iCloud is enabled.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our apps do not include third-party advertising networks or cross-app tracking libraries.
        If we ever introduce a feature that requires a third-party service, we will document it
        clearly here and in the app’s description.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If this privacy policy changes, we will update the effective date at the top of this page
        and summarize major changes in the app description or release notes where appropriate.
      </p>
