      <h2>Getting Help</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re having trouble with RankSpinnah or have questions about upcoming apps like ComicSpinnah,
        we’re happy to help. Spinnah is a one-person studio, so responses are personal, not automated.

      <h2>Reporting a Bug</h2>
      <p>
        When reporting a bug, it helps a lot if you can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which app and platform (e.g., RankSpinnah on macOS 15, iOS 18, etc.)</li>
        <li>What you were trying to do</li>
        <li>What you expected to happen</li>
        <li>What actually happened (including any error messages)</li>
        <li>Screenshots if you’re comfortable sharing them</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Feature Requests</h2>
      <p>
        Have an idea that would make a Spinnah app more useful, more fun, or just less annoying?
        Send it along — real-world usage is a big part of how future updates are prioritized.
      </p>
      <p>
        While not every request can make it into the apps, thoughtful feedback is always appreciated.
