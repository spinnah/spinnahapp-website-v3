      <h2>Built the Way Apps Should Be</h2>
      <p>
        We’re wicked tired of the subscription plague.  
        And the “buy it on iPhone then buy it again on Mac” scam?  
        <strong>Miss us with that.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Spinnah apps are native, fast, private, and built with intention —  
        no ads, no tracking, and no web wrappers pretending to be software.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Honest Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>If a Spinnah app works on multiple Apple platforms, you buy it once. Period.</strong>  
        Some apps start on one platform because that’s where they make the most sense —  
        but if an iOS app ever grows into a Mac app down the road?
        <strong>You’re already covered.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        No second purchase. No double dipping. No nonsense.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>No Subscriptions for Basic Features</h2>
      <p>
        We believe software should respect your time, attention, and wallet.  
        Spinnah apps avoid subscriptions unless there is a real, unavoidable,
        ongoing cost to operate a feature. So far?  
        <strong>We haven’t needed one.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Made by Someone Who Actually Uses This Stuff</h2>
      <p>
        Spinnah is a one-person, passion-driven studio — not a factory.  
        Everything is built with care, tested for real workflows,
        and designed around the kind of user experience we wish more apps had.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good software, made honestly.  
        That’s the whole deal.
